This is a comprehensive test message designed to showcase the enhanced EchoScan framework capabilities. 

The text includes various linguistic patterns, um, like hesitation markers... and even some tangential content. By the way, this should trigger the quirk detection systems effectively.

It also contains self-corrections - wait, I mean adjustments - and informal language patterns that are typical of human writing. The context drift analysis should identify multiple text blocks with varying semantic patterns.

Actually, let me add some more complexity here. The cross-modal consistency checks would benefit from having rich descriptive content, while the rolling reference system should be able to categorize this as conversational or informal domain content.

Anyway, this comprehensive test should demonstrate all six framework enhancements working together harmoniously.
